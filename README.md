# Project Title: Predicting Sleep Variables in Mammals

Description

This is a MsC student project for the Data ScienceTechnical Institute, France.
The project is to better understand Machine Learning with Python.
For this project we used data engineering, data science and data analysis techniques to see if it was possible to model and visualise the relationship between mammalian sleep patterns against a provided dataset
