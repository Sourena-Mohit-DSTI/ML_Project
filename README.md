First steps : Brandt
Hi all,

I've started some analysis on the data which I thought I would share, attached is a copy of my juypter notebook, the excel, and my environment settings. 

( conda env create -f brandt_sleep.yml #to recreate this environment otherwise, am using Python 3.10, packages called are identified in the notebook)

I may do some more on work on this over the weekend, if yes, I will send it around.

Bon week-end,

Brandt
