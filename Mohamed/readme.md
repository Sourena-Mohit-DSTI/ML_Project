The jupyter notebook file is well documented and contains many comments, don't hesitate to go through it step by step.

The source data is changed and is different from the initial "sleep_merged.csv" uploaded on Moodle. Some real data from 
biology sources have been added to the dataset, to the columns : "Gestation" and "LifeSpan". This is file 2.

The dataset was cleaned using mean value imputation as well as regression imputation. Standardization was made to rescale 
the data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The cleaned file is file 3.

You can also find a source file (file 4) corresponding to the sources used to manually input data into Gestation and LifeSpan.
